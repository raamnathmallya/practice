## Background

Psst.. is a map based social media application for events. Works similar to early days of instagram or twitter before they became super apps. Users feed contains events that are organized around them and can RSVP. Follow event managers and friends. Users can enlist events which they are organizing or interested in and get the word out. Private events can be organized to collect RSVP.

## Problem Statements

1. I am a veteran cricketer or a cricket fan. I like to watch local matches or attend local big screen match events. But I don't know when and where they are happening because either these info are published in one of many news papers or displayed on flex near the event which I will miss.
1. I am a devotee. I like to attend temple utsavas and other events happening around my place. But I cannot keep track of all the events and locations happening and most of the times I will miss them or by the time I know, I'd have made other plans. I need to be able to seamlessly add events to my calendar or TODO list.
1. I am a gen z new to blore. I like to attend music events organized. But book my show or paytm only shows paid events. In most cases open mic is free where young artists show up. I'd like to know when and where these events take place. Also be able to share this info with my friends over sm and get RSVP and plan the details.
1. I am a public event organizer. I'd like to organize an event, get it hyped and also be able to judge how many ppl are interested in the event and will be showing up. 

## Goals

- Create a simple app that does only one thing → Post Event Details → photo - description.
    - Akin to initial Instagram days. Where the app was only able to edit photos and upload. - like and comment. 
- Be able to load quickly, lightweight and consume less data. - cater to KaiOS also in future.
- Chat function available.
- Synced with Google maps to show where events are taking place.
- Sync with Uber, Ola and other ride sharing apps. (create a subsidiary for ride sharing in future if possible)
- 

**Non Goals**

- Not a photo sharing app.
- Not a socializing app. (but punters will flirt on gpay too so can't help it).
- No reels or statuses.

**Hypothesis**:

Current social media is filled with super apps which are bulky and eats away time. Almost all of SM is focusing on reels and post covid virtual meetups are increased to a level of saturation. Folks are looking for real human interaction. Apps such as meetup are doing exactly that. However, their reach is not at the grass root level and you need to be a part of certain groups. We are trying to simply provide a feed of all events happening around based on your interests.

This could very well branch out into subsidiary ventures for

- Ride sharing. Reason being - Some events taking place in remote location require transportation services.
- Event management - Tokyo project - which is a market place for all event management needs.

## Vision Narrative

On Nov 1 Kannada Rajyotsava, while returning from Banaswadi I had stopped at Orion Mall. Where I got to know that India matches of ICC men's world cup'23 were scheduled to be displayed on big screen in Orion Mall. Being a cricket fan I'd wanna be there with other fans cheering for my country than sitting and hooting at my TV back home. However, had I not been there at that moment, I'd have not known that orion mall has organized such an event. That is when the idea of Psst.. was formed.

Lets say I'm new to B'lore and I have diverse interests. I like to attend classical dance events at Seva Sadana or other cultural events at BIC or Town hall. I'm probably into fairs and exhibitions. However, for me to be aware of these events I need to follow news media, News papers, SM, see it on the flex or word of mouth. Wherein I need to update that info on my calendar and create reminders plan my schedule around it. Some handicrafts exhibition takes place in mantri mall. Ppl who are there at that moment know of it. rest of folks who are interested and don't even know it exists.

Psst.. tries to provide a platform a global notice board for all events.

## Rough Scoping & Timeline

At a high level, V1 includes a basic user creation and user profile. A news feed of all events around you based on interests selected during profile creation. A DM section for chatting. Authentication by Google/FB. A post is for an event contains series of photos or a video. Description with support for hyperlinks, hashtags, categories and tagging other users. Reaction includes - like/interested, dislike/ not interested, Going and comments. Comments section to support GIF and Image uploads. Basic idea is to follow twitter or Instagram in its initial days. A map section to display icons of events happening around you. This is optional for V1 and can be included in V2. However, for each event post - A map link is mandatory for offline events to show where it is happening. For online events, event link needs to be provided. This is purely app based and no website available.

Monetization model is similar to OLX.

At a high level, what's included in V1 vs. later versions? How big of a project is this? What's the roll out / testing plan? Consider the major pieces of functionality, Mobile, Platform, Internationalization, Entry Points, User Onboarding, Premium.
